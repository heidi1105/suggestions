# UserForm
### Learning Objective
- Apply React Hook (useState) and event listeners (onChange, onSubmit) on form submission 
- Render the list of the user after each successful submission 
- Bonus: Include front-end validation 
- Bonus: Being able to refactor all the form inputs into one state. 

### Tasks
- Create state variables for form input 
- Create a function that handles submission. Upon successful submission, alert with a message. 
- Create userList as state variable to store all the users that are submitted
- Upon successful submission, push the new user into the userList. (Note: state variables are immutable. You cannot use .push to state varaible)
- Display the users in the table below the form
- Bonus: 
  - Clear the form after each submission
  - Front-end validation (display validation message as users fill in the form. Avoid users from adding new user with an invalid form)
  - Use one state, and one handleInput to handle all the form inputs
